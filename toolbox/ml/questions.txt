1. What is the general trend in the curve?

The overall accuracy increases with the percentage of data used for training.
This means the curve increases. It's also concave down because the rate of
accuracy increase is reduced as the percentage of data used increases.


2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?

The graph is noisier when a higher percentage of the data is used in training.
This is probably because the closer the accuracy gets to 100%, the more drastic
small variations in accuracy will appear in relation (i.e. an especially 
accurate or inaccurate result will be very noisy in comparison to the others.


3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?

I tested up to 70 trials, but the graph looked about as smooth from ~50 plus 
trials. Further increase may smooth it out a bit more, but I doubt by much.


4. Try different values for C.  What happens?

When higher values of C are used, the accuracy reaches a higher maximum.
